## P.S. A Quick Note on Tab Groups

For now, Zen Tab Sorter regards your tab groups like a wise monk watching the world's chaos—with understanding, but without interfering. In other words, it doesn't sort them yet. We're working on teaching it this particular form of zen. Until then, don't be alarmed if your groups are living their own life. Every tab has its own path to enlightenment.
