# Zen Tab Sorter

An addon that organizes your tabs by domain.

## How It Works

Zen Tab Sorter is an extremely simple but useful extension for anyone who works with a large number of tabs. It automatically moves newly opened tabs next to other tabs from the same domain. For example, if you open a new YouTube video, it will be placed next to your other YouTube tabs.

## Installation

This addon is available on the **Firefox Addons** store:

## Features

- **Automatic Sorting**: Newly opened tabs are automatically moved next to tabs with the same domain.
- **Lightweight**: The addon is designed to be minimal and not consume system resources.
- **Simple and Intuitive**: No complex settings or configurations are needed. It just works.
